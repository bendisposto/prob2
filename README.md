**IMPORTANT:** The layout of the repository has changed! The Eclipse/Rodin plugin was moved to a separate repository: http://github.com/bendisposto/prob2-plugin. This repository only contains the Kernel of ProB 2.0. 

The last version before the restructuring is tagged as preRestructure. 

The project is intended for internal usage, do not rely on any of the features or interfaces in this project. 

The source code of the current ProB release is located at http://github.com/bendisposto/prob

# Setting up a development environment
ProB 2.0 works with Java 7 on Mac OS, Windows and most Linux distributions. 

We assume, you have a fresh copy of Eclipse and an empty workspace at hand. We use Luna SR2. Furthermore, we assume that you have a recent version of gradle (http://www.gradle.org/) installed on your computer. Gradle 1.1 or newer will be sufficient.

1. In Eclipse: Install the Groovy/Grails Tool Suite from the Eclipse Market Place. You can leave out the Grails IDE, Spring Dashboard and all features starting with Pivotal. For Eclipse Mars, see https://tedvinke.wordpress.com/2015/10/17/eclipse-mars-grails-3-1-with-gradle-groovy-and-gsp-support/ for installation instructions. Use the Groovy 2.4 Compiler feature.
2. Clone the prob2 repository to some location (e.g. gitrepo/prob2). 
   We assume that gitrepo is a directory outside your Eclipse workspace. 
3. cd into gitrepo/prob2/de.prob2.kernel, switch to the development branch (git checkout develop) and run `gradle eclipse` 
4. In Eclipse, import project from gitrepo/prob2/de.prob2.kernel
